            <p> For this project I redesigned the Department of Education's landing page and FAFSA form. This started as
              a group project, which then transistioned into an independant one. While we were in our group I assumed a
              leadership position and spearheaded ideas, coordinated our meetings, and made sure all team members had
              their deliverables done on time.</p>

              total and put our put our findings in a miro board and compared their similarities and differences.
              Unsurprisingly, we found that our users were frusterated with the overall architecture of the Department
              of Education on both the desktop and mobile. They felt they needed more guidance from the navigation, and
              a more intuative site map.</p>

              to see what was actually accessible for the user and what wasn't. We found that most of the information on
              the site was presented in through clickable links instead in actual copy, and that each of these links
              lead to different pages that ultimately had very little information yet still had many links. </p>

              Help, Press, Language, and Covid pages on the top navigation bar, but in the high-fidelity they ended up
              on the footer, as they weren’t as crucial. </p>

            <p> As I created the low-fidelity prototype, I wanted to create a footer and header that clearly labeled the
              different pages of the site. I wasn’t sure how to organize it, so I gave it a simplistic set up that would
              be easy to work with in later iterations.</p>

              I also created copy that was supportive and direct to the viewer. I had similar ideas when chosing
              Questrial as the font and my images, as they were both formal, engaging, and could appeal to a wider age
              demograpic. </p>

              icons, and a blue text field under the copy that was on the images. I added the search bar to the top
              header as this was easier for the user to engage with, and kept the login as a separate part of the

            <p> I conducted seven user tests, and found that a majority of them found the pages in the mobile seemed to
              blend together as the copy was similar on each page. With the desktop, I found that my users were confused
              by the button "Back", which would enable the user to return to the home screen. For the mobile, I added
              icons on the pages to reflect what task had been achieved on that page, and for the desktop I changed the
              button to "Return". </p>

            <p>In the end I learned a lot from this assignment. My foremost concern was to design a userflow that
              reflected the support and ease that was clearly missing in the original flow. I felt that though my
              designs are more engaging that the current DoED, I believe I still should add more icons to the desktop,
              and should add a process bar to the FAFSA pages.</p>
